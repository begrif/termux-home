$HOME/bin tools for Termux
==========================

Termux is a full-featured Linux environment for Andriod. It
also acts as an app that links can be shared with and images
"edited" with. I have tools for bookmarking links and rewriting
images before putting them on the web.

The MKSUBS tool is a basic templater for hiding passwords that
I keep inside scripts. `make install` runs the template script.
